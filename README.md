# Workforce-Forecasting-Health-Canada-PHAC-

## Introduction:
The project outlined herein delves into a comprehensive analysis of workforce forecasting for Health Canada, aimed at addressing critical organizational needs through informed decision-making. With a focus on meticulous study and data analysis, our endeavour is to provide actionable insights to enhance operational efficiency and resource allocation within Health Canada.

At its core, this project aims to dissect the current state of Health Canada's workforce dynamics, identifying key trends, challenges, and opportunities that shape its staffing requirements. By leveraging advanced methodologies such as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Modeling, and Data Visualization using Microsoft Power BI, we seek to gain a nuanced understanding of the organization's diverse workforce landscape.

Central to our mission is the fulfilment of the client's need for predictive job forecasting across various categories, including geographical requirements, departmental allocations, and other crucial parameters influencing workforce dynamics. Through applying sophisticated techniques such as time series analysis and decomposition tree models, we endeavour to deliver the best story-telling visuals tailored to Health Canada's specific needs.

This project represents a collaborative effort to harness industry best practices and innovative tactics to meet the challenges faced by Health Canada in optimizing its workforce planning strategies. By offering strategic recommendations grounded in robust data analysis, we aim to empower Health Canada with the tools necessary to navigate its staffing requirements effectively and efficiently.

## Opportunity Restatement:
The opportunity provided by the client, Health Canada, entails the need for an in-depth analysis and predictive forecasting of workforce requirements. This project addresses the challenge of accurately predicting job demands within the organization, considering various factors such as geographical requirements, department categories, and other significant parameters affecting workforce allocation.

The main problem at hand is aligning NOC insights within internal needs for job forecasting within Health Canada. The organization requires a solution that can anticipate workforce needs based on factors like geographical distribution, departmental requirements, time series analysis, NOC (National Occupational Classification) levels, and provincial analysis down to the city level.

The challenge is to develop a robust forecasting system that can effectively predict future workforce demands, optimize resource allocation, and ensure that Health Canada operates efficiently in meeting its staffing needs across diverse departments and locations.
## Logical Solution:

* Identifying key drivers: By looking at historical data, we can determine the key drivers that influence workforce demand.

* Scenario Planning: Developing different scenarios based on varying assumptions about the future.

* Demand Forecasting: Using statistical techniques like Time Series Analysis to forecast.

* Gap Analysis: Comparing forecasted demand with projected supply to identify any gaps in the workforce.

### The rationale behind these approaches

* Data-Driven: By relying on historical data and statistical analysis, this approach ensures that forecasts are based on objective information rather than guesswork.

* Flexible: Scenario planning allows for flexibility in responding to different future scenarios, ensuring that organizations are prepared for various possibilities.

* Iterative: Continuous monitoring and adjustment ensure that forecasts remain relevant and accurate in the face of changing circumstances.

### Alternative Approaches

* Qualitative Forecasting: Instead of relying solely on quantitative data, providing qualitative methods such as expert opinions and surveys could be used to complement quantitative analysis.

* Bottom-Up Forecasting: Instead of starting with aggregate workforce demand forecasts, this approach involves forecasting at the individual job level and aggregating up to obtain overall workforce projections.

## Proposed Data Story:
